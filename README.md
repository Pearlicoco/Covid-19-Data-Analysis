INTRODUCTION

This is an analysis on the corona virus pandemic, the data was gotten from ourworldindata.org It consists of data from the day of the virus outbreak till date. When the data was downloaded it spans from January 8 2020 to August 9 2023. For this analysis, I focused my analysis on the total death rate per continent, the global figures from the total cases to the the death rate, trend so the infected population e.t.c

TOOLS USED

DATA EXPLORATION & CLEANING

The data downloaded was first opened in Excel. The data was explored and broken down into two parts. The first one consisting of information on the Covid Deaths while the other containing information on the Covid Vaccination. Then I created a Covid-19 Database in MySQL and imported the two dataset into the database. I went futher to select the data I wanted to work with to answer the following questions and generate useful insights.

QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED

1. What is the likelihood of dying if you contract Covid in your country?
2. What percentage of the population is infected with Covid?
3. What countries has the highest infection rate compared to population?
4. What are countries with the highest death rate per population?
5. What percentage of the population has recieved at least one Covid Vaccine?

DATA VISUALIZATION

After carrying out the data analysis on SQL, I then imported the data into Tableau for visualization. Four different visualizations was made and then put together as a dashboard to convery the various insights that was generated.
Here is a link to my Tableau Public to view the dashboard: https://public.tableau.com/views/Covid-19DataViz_16920482721390/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

FINDINGS

1. The total cases recorded globally was about 769.4M, with about 7.1M deaths.
2. The continent "Europe" recorded the highest death rate of about 2.1M
3. France has the highest infected population with about 57.5%
4. Using USA as a case study, the forecast indicator shows that by December 2024 the average percentage of infected population will be about 15.74%

Thank you for sticking with me.
